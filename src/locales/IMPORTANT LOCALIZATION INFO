In case a new lang is added, it should be added to the function verifyLang of Utils as well, but only after
adding all the necessary lang images:
    - starter_select_bg_LANGNAME
    - summary_bg_LANGNAME
    - summary_moves_LANGNAME
    - summary_moves_effect_LANGNAME
    - summary_profile_LANGNAME
    - summary_stats_LANGNAME
    - summary_tabs_1_LANGNAME
    - summary_tabs_2_LANGNAME
    - summary_tabs_3_LANGNAME
These images should be added to the legacy folder as well
